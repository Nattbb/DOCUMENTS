# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers. It's a great tool for quick calculations with a touch of fun! 😊

## Features ✨

- **Addition** (`+`) - Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction** (`-`) - Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication** (`*`) - Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division** (`/`) - Divides the first number by the second (no zero division checks—yet!).

## How to Use 🚀

1. **Run the script** in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. **Enter the first number** when prompted.
3. **Enter the second number** when prompted.
4. **View the results**—the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers will be displayed.

### Example:
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Notes ⚠️

- The calculator uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers.
- Division by zero will cause an error (future updates may handle this gracefully!).

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Add error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
- Include division by zero protection.
- Extend functionality with more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
